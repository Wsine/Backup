# Linux

there are some useful setting for linux user, and I also offer an install.sh file for it.

guide:

```shell
# only download static files
wget -O - https://raw.githubusercontent.com/Wsine/Backup/master/linux/install.sh | bash
# download and install zsh and vim with plugins
wget -O - https://raw.githubusercontent.com/Wsine/Backup/master/linux/install.sh | bash -s all
```
